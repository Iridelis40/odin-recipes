    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Spaghetti: This recipe, which makes about four servings, starts with one pound of uncooked spaghetti. </li>
      <li>Oil: You’ll need ½ cup of olive oil. 
      </li>
      <li>Garlic: Six cloves of thinly sliced garlic lends bold flavor.

      <li>Seasonings: This traditional spaghetti aglio e olio is flavored with crushed red pepper flakes, black pepper, and fresh parsley. 
      </li>
      <li>Cheese: For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese instead of opting for the pre-shredded stuff. 
      </li>
    </ul>
